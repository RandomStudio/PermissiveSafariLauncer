# Permissive Safari Launcher

A very permissive, light iOS Safari web view launcher app. Useful for hosted environments that need to display a web app.

Features:
* URL editable in Settings screen
* CORS bypassed globally
* HTTP is treated as HTTPS (allows camera etc APIs to run on HTTP dev servers)
* Automatically accept camera/media permissions requests, without dialog
* Allow video/audio content to autoplay without interaction
* Ensure window is inspectable via Safari
